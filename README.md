# Final-Project-VR

This was my final project for my Business Intelligence class from undergraduate in Spring 2022. I chose VR as my topic because I'm very passionate about it. I used Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to identify what hardware and software characteristics increase immersion. The Python code and report are in here.
